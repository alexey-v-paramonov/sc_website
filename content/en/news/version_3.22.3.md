Internet Radio control panel 3.22.3 is out: Radio and channel traffic is now calculated more accurate. Volume spikes were noticed in live broadcasts (both volume up and down), this has now been fixed. For playlists that start at the end of the main playlist, you can now specify separately whether to play jingles in it and whether to fulfill listeners' requests. That is, when creating an event in the grid, more options will now be added. The FLAC codec crashed on some servers, which made it impossible for channels to work in this format: fixed. The randomizer of random playback in tracks has been completely rewritten, there have been many complaints about it, we hope all problems will be solved in the new one. We've tweaked the replay protection for the performer a bit.
