Internet Radio control panel 3.23.3 is out: Added the ability to play a playlist inside the block in order, that is, a block of jingles was started, a track from a given playlist was played in order, the next time the block was started, the next track from the playlist, and so on. Added the option to change the volume of the stream for DJs (and for those who connect remotely and for an auto DJ). DJs now have an option to record the broadcast. All records are saved on the server, they can be downloaded or deleted. Several fixes to the broadcast grid and acceleration of its operation.
