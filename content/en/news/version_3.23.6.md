Our Internet Radio control panel 3.23.8 has been released: The text voiceover module has been added - now you can enter text in the radio admin panel and voice it using Artificial Intelligence and get a ready-made mp3 file that can be used as a jingle or track in playlists. In track editing mode, the ability to reset the number of likes, dislikes and the number of track orders by listeners has been added. Recordings of DJs' broadcasts can now be copied to playlists and podcasts. A new updated radio mini-site with a lot of settings, the ability to view it directly from the panel or download and install it on any hosting.
