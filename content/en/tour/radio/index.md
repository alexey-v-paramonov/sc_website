Our main product, which we use to build our other products on top of it, is the Internet Radio control panel - that's why we call it the Internet Radio "Platform". The product has been continuously developing since 2006. 
Our control panel is not only a WEB interface for radio broadcasting via standard Icecast and Shoutcast servers, but also contains its own broadcasting module (Auto-DJ), where you can upload music for rotation and broadcasting will work in fully automatic mode, without using third-party broadcasting programs such as Sam Broadcaster or Audio Hijack, although our platform is also compatible with these programs and can use them as a source. One of the most frequently used scenarios is broadcasting from the server in fully automatic mode via Auto-DJ and connecting an external source as Audio Hijack and other broadcasting programs when it is necessary to host a live stream on the radio.

Our platform allows you to:
- broadcast synchronously in different formats (MP3, AAC++, FLAC, bitrates from 16kbps to 320kbps)
- track the radio audience - from basic statistics in numbers, to displaying your listenes on the World map is real time
- go live on air at any time
- manage playlists
- program the broadcast and schedule the broadcast of playlists at a certain time via the scheduler
- manage jingles and advertisements
- broadcast directly via the browser
- receive calls from listeners without installing additional software (when broadcasting through the browser, the listener also "calls" the host from the browser)
- add several live streaming hosts (DJs) to the radio and control access to the broadcast
- relay other Internet radio streams
- edit music files uploaded to the server in Auto-DJ, mark min in/out points
- manage Podcasts, create RSS feeds, episodes and have a ready-made WEB module for listening to podcasts
- use Artificial Intelligence to voice over any text and immediately use the audio clips on the air
- send a link to a ready-made website "out of the box" to your listeners
- use the API for software integration into your own websites, modules and applications
- work with several separate stations within the same account

Our Internet Radio panel can be installed on almost any server running Linux. A virtual server with 1 CPU core and 1gb of RAM is just enough to have 1-5 radios running. Creating a radio is also possible directly on our servers, if you do not have your own server. There is no need to have your own computer permanently connected to the Internet for broadcasting, and please note that in the case of hosting our control panel on your own hosting: common website hosting is not suitable for the panel, you need a dedicated server: virtual or physical.
