### Internet Radio Streaming and Traffic Consumption

#### For Listeners:
When listening to internet radio, it feels like an "endless" file download because the streaming audio is played almost in real-time while gradually being "downloaded" to the listener's device. At the same time:
- Over **Wi-Fi** — data usage is usually not charged.
- Over a **Mobile network** — data may be charged according to your mobile operator’s plan.

Approximate data usage depends on the stream quality:

- **128 kbps (MP3)** — about **1 MB** per minute or **60 MB per hour**.
- **256 kbps (MP3)** — about **2 MB** per minute or **120 MB per hour**.
- **Mobile-optimized formats (AAC++, HE-AAC 32 kbps)** — only 15 MB per hour while maintaining good sound quality. Our platform supports these formats.

#### For Radio Station Owners

Streaming Options:

- **Auto-DJ (automated streaming from the server)** — all traffic is handled by the server; the owner doesn’t generate any traffic on their side.
- **Live Broadcasting (streaming from your computer to the server)** — your traffic usage equals that of one listener. For example, streaming at 128 kbps (MP3) will consume about 60 MB per hour on your side.

**Server Traffic and Bandwidth Requirements:**

Server traffic is typically not charged by hosting providers, but the bandwidth capacity is crucial. Common bandwidth allocations are:

- **100 Mbps**
- **1 Gbps**

For streaming at **128 kbps (MP3)**, a server with:

- **100 Mbps bandwidth** can support up to **700 concurrent listeners**, generating around 4 GB of traffic per hour.
- **1 Gbps bandwidth** can support up to **7000 concurrent listeners**, generating around 40 GB of traffic per hour.

#### Important:
When you order internet radio hosting from us, traffic is not metered and does not affect the cost of the service.
