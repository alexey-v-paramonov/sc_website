Version 3.25.0 is out:
- Random playback for the playlists is completley rewritten, now there are 2 random playback modes available in "settings". One is using a "balanced" mode that is choosing a random track trying to escape same artists as uch as possible, another one is using a random permitation of tracks in a playlist.
- Icecast2 protocol now supported for live streaming (Shoutcast version 1 protocol was only available before). 
- Fixed noise that occurs in some crossfade modes.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs reported by our users.
