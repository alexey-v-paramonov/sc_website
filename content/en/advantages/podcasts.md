In addition to online streaming, our Internet Radio Platform also supports on-demand content like podcasts. You can create podcasts, add episodes - all this will be displayed to your listeners in the form of a convenient player page. The podcast module can also be connected to the radio site, which is included in the package and, of course, provide an RSS feed for each of the podcasts so that listeners can listen to them in any podcast receiver.
