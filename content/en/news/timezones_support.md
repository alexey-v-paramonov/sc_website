Support for different time zones has been completely rewritten. Added the ability to add links to files available by URL to playlists and jingles (remote files support_). For DJs, you can set the encoding of meta data. Speeding up the loading of the broadcast grid. Now you can set your own meta-data format for the DJ - not just "Artist - title", but, for example, "Artist - Album - Title", other formats are supported. Work with low-quality streams has been fixed for repeaters. Improved the search for track covers on iTunes/Last FM.
