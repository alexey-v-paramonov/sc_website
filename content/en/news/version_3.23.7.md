Our Internet Radio control panel 3.23.8 has been released: Completely rewritten volume normalization in tracks, now there will be no crackling in those tracks where clipping sometimes happened + smoother alignment. New options in the mini-site + fix for all bugs that were reported to our technical support. Lots of minor edits and improvements.
