All our users have the option to create mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms which are deeply integrated with our Internet radio control panel. We have created our own application engine, which is optimized for listening to the radio and takes into account all the subtleties of working on the device, for example, reconnecting to the radio stream in case of loss of connection, full Bluetooth functionality support, and so on. We have been developing applications since 2011 and have already published more than 200 different applications on Google Play and the Apple App Store. We develop both universal applications that represent standard functionality which are fully customizable for radio (logos, streams and any branding) and are inexpensive, and we can also develope a completely individual application of any complexity individually.
