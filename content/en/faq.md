1. While listening, the radio may pause, buffer, cut out or doesn't play at all.

    In 99% of cases, the issue is due to an unstable connection between your device and the server streaming the radio. Even if you have a high-speed wired internet connection, the data may travel through many intermediate nodes and providers, and a problem at any of these points can affect playback.

    Make sure your device is not downloading large amounts of data from the internet while you’re listening.

    If you are the radio station owner, check the server’s CPU load.

    If your radio is built on our platform, unfortunately, we cannot influence the network performance or resolve the issue, as it is not a software-related problem.

2. Is live broadcasting supported on your platform?

    Yes, it is. You can either use specialized software such as SAM Broadcaster, BUTT or Audio Hijack, or broadcast directly through your browser.    

3. Can I use my own domain name for the radio and streams?

    Yes, you can. Whether our broadcasting platform is hosted on your server or ours, you can configure it to work with your own domain. HTTPS is fully supported (a free SSL certificate is provided), and even the direct audio stream URLs will use your domain.

4. How does the payment work?

    All payments are made through your [personal account](https://app.streaming.center/), which becomes available after registration. You top up your account balance in advance, and when a service is provided, the required amount is automatically deducted according to its cost.
