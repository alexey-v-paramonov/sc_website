Internet Radio control panel 3.23.3 is out: Added and improved translations into French, Ukrainian, Turkish, German, Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian. A small number of fixes in various modules, including in the broadcast grid When broadcasting from the RadioBOSS program (and others), the number of current listeners will now be reflected directly in the broadcast program. The base volume level of the Auto DJ was slightly lowered (by 9%) so that when equalizing the sound, overlapping tracks there would be no sound artifacts and noises.
