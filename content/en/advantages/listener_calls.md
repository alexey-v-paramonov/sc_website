Our Internet Radio Platform not only supports broadcasting directly from the browser, but also has a unique opportunity to receive calls from listeners directly from the browser. You can send any listener a special URL, by clicking on which they will be able to call you live from the browser and you, having accepted an incoming call, can take the listener live. The listener does not need to install any additional software to make a call - he calls directly through the browser (mobile browsers are also supported).
