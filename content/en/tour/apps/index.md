According to our customers reviews who already use our mobile applications, more than 30% of listeners come to their radio from mobile applications.
It is the mobile applications for listening to your Internet Radio that allow you to significantly expand the audience of listeners.
Developing a mobile application from scratch can be quite expensive (and yes, we do that too), but in most cases it is enough for a radio station to have a simple application with all the functions necessary for the listener and be customizable, which is implemented in our mobile application builder.

The basic application created in our app builder can be customized completely for the branding of your radio, including the logo, icons, information, radio streams, in one application you can add several stations and even customize all the colors in the application or choose a ready-made "skin".

We are constantly adding new functionality to our mobile application engine, this includes support for the latest versions of Android and iOS, compatibility with new devices, and expansion of functions and much more, as the field of mobile devices is constantly changing. As a user of the final product, you do not need to worry about this - it is enough to receive all the updates that become available to you in the contructor over time and simply publish application updates.

Some of the features of our applications:
- stable operation of the radio stream, including the restoration of communication and audio playback after a connection break or an incoming call.
- full Bluetooth support, including the transmission of track covers via Bluetooth to devices that support it (for example, multimedia headsets in cars)
- Android Auto support
- Android TV support
- if the radio itself is built on our Radio Platform, the application is expanded with additional features: shoutbox, likes and dislikes, track covers 
- The application can be created for any radio, not limited to our Radio Platform users
- track covers
- support for any number of radios in one application, the ability to switch appears automatically
- synchronization of radio streams between the application builder and the application itself, that is, you do not have to update the application if the URL of the radio stream has changed
- radio shutdown timer
- timer alarm clock that turns on the radio at a certain time
- HLS streaming support

The application can be made and published both from our developer account and yours when providing access to it at the time of publication. We support publishing on Google Play, Apple App Store and other on-demand stores. And yes, we even pay 100 USD per year for an Apple developer account and you do not need to pay anything (if the application is published from our account, of course).

Based on our universal app engine, we can individually build an application of any complexity. Contact us and we will discuss all the details and the possibility of implementing your wishes in the application.
