All modules and our Internet Radio Control Panel itself fully support the HTTPS protocol. Broadcasting via Icecast, Shoutcast and proxies also support HTTPS, all settings are automatic, it is enough to connect the domain name to the broadcast and then our Radio Platform will configure everything automatically.
