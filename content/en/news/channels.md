A new feature has been added to broadcast in several streams with different quality synchronously. Just create additional broadcast channels in the desired quality and format - and the stream will automatically and synchronously split into these channels. Thus, listeners will be able to choose a convenient stream to listen to, depending on the speed of their Internet connection.
