Added relay support for third-party Internet radio streams. Now at a certain time (via the scheduler) You can broadcast a stream from another streaming radio station. You can add the URL of streams in the "Relays" section and in the "Scheduler" section when adding an event, the "Start relay" checkmark is now available, if it is checked, the stream from the selected relay will go on the air, and not the playlist, as usual.
