- Added the ability to disable crossfade for tracks and jingles.
- Admin area now includes an option to disable Live DJ recordings, helping save disk space.
- Updated volume normalization target to -14 LUFS (previously -18 LUFS), resulting in a slightly louder stream.

- Added a setting for Auto-DJ to either resume from where it left off or start a new track after switching from a live stream.
