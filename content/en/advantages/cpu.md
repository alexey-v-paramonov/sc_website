The engine that we use for broadcasting and audio processing is written in C++ and is highly optimized, so the load on the server processor is very low. To run up to 5 radios on one server, you will only need a server with 1 processor core and 1GB of RAM, and on a modern server on a processor, for example, Core i5 13500, you can run up to 300 Internet radios simultaneously. Our product outperforms radios based on Liquidsoap by about 15-20% in terms of CPU performance.
