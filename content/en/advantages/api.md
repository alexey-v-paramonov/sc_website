Our Internet-radio control panel provides its own API for almost any functionality, allowing you to trigger various functions programmatically and create your own script to contol it. Using the API, you can create your own scripts for the site, mobile applications, players, and more. The essence of the API is simple - You access the panel at a specific URL, and it outputs data in JSON format, which you then use in your scripts in PHP, Javascript and other languages. API request authentication is supported. [API documentation is here]({{<ref "/docs">}}).
