Don't have your own website for radio? No problem, a ready-made website is already built into our Internet Radio Platform. You can configure which sections to display on it directly from the control panel, upload a logo, add your own HTML code. You will have: an interactive listener map, shoutbox, podcasts, feedback, links to social networks, a hit parade of the best tracks, news. There are dark and light themes too!
