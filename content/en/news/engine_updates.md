 First of all, we would like to congratulate everyone on the New Year 2020! As the creators of the Internet radio broadcasting service, we would like to see more reliable operation of our software and even more satisfied customers in the New Year! Therefore, we suggest entering the New Year with a large list of updates and improvements in our software, namely:

 - Correction of the random playback mode in playlists.
 - If there is an update, you will see a message in the control panel about the need to restart the radio server.
 - Fixed working with meta data in repeaters.
 - Several fixes in the broadcast scheduler.
 - Fixed a memory leak.
 - A ban on repeating random jingles.
 - A ban on repeating random jingles in jingle blocks.
 - A ban on repeating random tracks inside the block if this track has already been played earlier in this playlist.
