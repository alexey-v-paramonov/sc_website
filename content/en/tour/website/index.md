    So, you have a radio, the stream is working, but how quickly do you get the first listeners? Even send something to friends, colleagues, so the could see what kind of radio you have: name, description, what social networks and connected resources are there, watch the broadcast and, most importantly, listen to the radio in a nice interface? To do this, our Radio Platform already has a ready-made and free website for radio! You immediately have a link to it in the WEB interface of the control panel and, if desired, you can download the site files and place them on any website hosting, since our site does not contain any code except HTML and Javascript, even PHP is not used. 
    <br /><br />
    Most of the options are configured in the radio control panel.
    Single website can have several stations attached, allowing you to switch between them using a dropdown menu.
