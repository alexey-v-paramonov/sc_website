### Listening to Internet radio

Listening to Internet radio is easy and can be done using various software and hardware options across different devices and operating systems. Below is a detailed guide.

#### Official radio website
The easiest way to listen to Internet radio is by visiting the station’s website and using its built-in audio player, if available. Look for a "Listen Live" button which is usually prominently displayed on the homepage or in a "Live" section. Most modern stations use HTML5 players that work instantly without downloads. Adjust volume or settings directly on the website's player by using volume controls and quality selection buttons. This is the easiest way to listent to the radio because you do not need to have any additional applications or an account, the stream works directly in your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.) and any device: smartphone, tablet, computer, or smart TV browser.

Stations often prioritize their own websites over third-party apps and may even hide their streaming links to drive more traffic to their official site.

Along with the built-in player, a radio station’s website may provide direct links to stream the broadcast using third-party player applications, allowing you to listen without visiting the website. Streaming links are different from regular website links - they provide direct access to the audio stream. While you can open them in a browser, which may display a built-in player, the best way to use them is with a dedicated media player.

If a radio station has an official mobile app, the website will usually include links to download it from Google Play or the Apple App Store.

Many stations do not have an official website, but their streaming links can be found in radio player directories and aggregator platforms.

#### Player programs
Listening to Internet radio on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS operating systems can be done using various media players that support streaming. 

To listen to Internet radio in a media player, you first need to obtain a direct link to the radio stream. Once you have the link, open your preferred media player, find the option to open a network stream or URL, enter the streaming URL, and click Play.
