**Step-by-step guide**
1. Go to the <a href="https://app.streaming.center/login/" target="_blank">order page and register</a>
2. In your dashboard, open the "Applications" -> "Android" section
3. Click "Create Mobile App" and choose the basic app settings: name, publishing parameters, and copyright settings
4. Fill out all fields in the "Information" section: full and short description, upload logos and icons
5. Customize the app appearance in the "Design" section: choose a ready-made skin or set all color elements individually
6. In the "Radios" section, you can add **unlimited radio streams** to the app. If multiple stations are added, a station-switching menu will appear in the app
7. Each station can have its own logo, stream links, social media links, and a custom "Info" section
8. Once all information is filled out correctly, click the "Build App" button in the top menu and wait for the compilation to complete — typically 10–15 minutes
9. Once your app is ready, the download button for the APK file will become available — this file can be downloaded and installed on Android devices (you may need to allow installation from unknown sources on your device)

After the app is created, you will have **5 days of free testing** - install it on various Android devices to fully test its functionality. During testing, you can return to the builder, change any settings, and rebuild the app — all free of charge.

Only when you're completely satisfied do you need to make a payment and order publishing of your app in app stores.

You can share the APK file or a link to your app on Google Play/Huawei App Gallery on your radio station’s website so listeners can easily find and install it.
