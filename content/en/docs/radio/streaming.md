### Primary ways of Internet Radio Broadcasting

1. #### Broadcasting from a Media Library (Automated)
This is the simplest method to set up and maintain. It involves uploading audio files to a server, creating and configuring playlists, rotations, and jingles, and scheduling broadcasts using a programming grid (assigning specific playlists and rotations to play at designated times). The audio is streamed in a fully automated mode via a rotation program, commonly referred to as an "Auto-DJ."

  **Advantages:**

   - Easy setup and configuration
   - Minimal administrator involvement
   - Stable and fully automated 24/7 operation

  **Requirements:**

   - A server with sufficient disk space to store all audio content
   - Regular updates to the media library to keep listeners engaged
   - Basic management of playlists and broadcast scheduling


2. #### Live Broadcasting (Live Streaming)

This method involves setting up a live broadcast source, which could be a studio, computer, or even a smartphone. Special software is usually required, though in many cases, a web browser is sufficient. A stable connection to the server is crucial - not necessarily a fast one, but a reliable one. The audio signal is transmitted from the broadcasting source to the server, which then distributes it to listeners.

  **Advantages:**

   - Ability to go live, including voice broadcasting
   - Interaction with listeners, including live call-ins

  **Requirements:**

   - A broadcasting computer
   - A microphone/audio interface
   - A reliable internet connection
   - Broadcasting software (or a browser)
