## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. **Download** the latest [version of the module](https://github.com/alexey-v-paramonov/streamingcenter_whmcs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip the file.

2. Upload the "streamingcenter" folder from the archive into:

   ```
   /modules/servers/
   ```

   on your WHMCS server, so that the final path to the module would be:

   ```
   /modules/servers/streamingcenter
   ```

   and the module files on your sever should be located inside the `/modules/servers/streamingcenter` folder like this:
   ```
   /modules/servers/streamingcenter/hooks.php
   /modules/servers/streamingcenter/logo.png
   /modules/servers/streamingcenter/readme.txt
   /modules/servers/streamingcenter/streamingcenter.php
   ```

   Folder naming and location are **important for the module to work correctly**.

3. **Configure** the module in WHMCS Admin:

    Go to **System Settings > Products/Services > Servers**  
    
    Add a new server using the module: "Streaming.Center"

    Enter your Streaming.Center admin credentials (it is available after Streaming.Center installation)
    {{< lightbox "/images/whmcs/add_server_mini.png" "/images/whmcs/add_server.png" >}}

4. **Assign** the module to your WHMCS products.

    Create a new **Product** in WHMCS: 
    go to **System Settings > Products/Services** and click **Create a New Product**.

    You can give your product a name whatever you want, but you have to set "Streaming.Center" as the **Module**
    
    {{< lightbox "/images/whmcs/add_product_mini.png" "/images/whmcs/add_product.png" >}}

    When the package is ready you can configure the settings by navigating to **Module Settings** and choosing a broadcaster template (you need to create it in your Streaming.Center admin area first) or by picking individual account settings by choosing "No Template" in **Radio Account Template**.

    {{< lightbox "/images/whmcs/edit_product_mini.png" "/images/whmcs/edit_product.png" >}}

5. **Creating** a new order.    

    Now you can go to **Orders** and click **Add New Order**
    {{< lightbox "/images/whmcs/add_order_mini.png" "/images/whmcs/add_order.png" >}}

    pick the product that you have created in step **#4** and click **Submit Order**.

    {{< lightbox "/images/whmcs/submit_order.png" "/images/whmcs/submit_order.png" >}}

    Make sure to check **Run Module Create** - it will trigger broadacster account creation in Streaming.Center, pick your broadcaster account **username** and the password. You will not be able to change the username later and it should be unique.

    Click **Accept order**. It will take a few minutes for the broadcaster account to create in Streaming.Center.

5. **Updating** an existing order.    
    When your order is in "Active" state and the broadcaster accoutn is ready and running in Streaming.Center you can change the account options individually. To do that you need to find your order, click on it and then click **Product/Service** link in the "Item" column of the **Order Items** table. Inside the **Products/Services** tab you will find all your broadacster account ptions and functions like account suspension, password change and termination.
    You can also change individual accoutn settign using this form:
