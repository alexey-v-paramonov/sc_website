In addition to the standard well-known streaming programs (Audio Hijack, Radioboss, Sam Broadcaster, BUTT, and so on) - You can broadcast directly from the browser. You can stream music, speak into a microphone, and even receive incoming calls from listeners live. Yes, the sound quality and the ability to fine-tune all parameters are not the same as in professional programs, but you do not need to install any additional programs and in many cases a Web browser is already enough to stream live.
