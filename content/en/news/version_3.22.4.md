Internet Radio control panel 3.23.0 is out: In jingle blocks, you can now insert an entire playlist between in and outgoing jingles (previously it was possible to insert only one track). This way, you can surround a certain playlist with incoming and outgoing jingles. Fixed a small bug in the order in which tracks are played in rotations.
