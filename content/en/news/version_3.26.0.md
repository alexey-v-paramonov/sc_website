Version 3.26.0 is out:
- Music processing now utilizes all CPU cores, significantly speeding up performance (e.g., ~4Ã— faster on a 4-core CPU).
- Automatically retrieves track title and artist from the filename if MP3 tags are missing.
- Added an option to trim silence at the beginning and end of tracks.
- Added the ability to disable crossfade for tracks and jingles.
- Admin area now includes an option to disable Live DJ recordings, helping save disk space.
- Updated volume normalization target to -14 LUFS (previously -18 LUFS), resulting in a slightly louder stream.
- Added separate volume adjustment options for tracks and jingles.
- Webcaster for unbranded licenses no longer links to our portal.
- Added a setting for Auto-DJ to either resume from where it left off or start a new track after switching from a live stream.
