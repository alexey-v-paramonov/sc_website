## Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy outlines the terms under which the "Streaming.Center" service and its mobile applications for listening to internet radio collect and use information.

We take privacy very seriously.

### Internet Radio Creation Service "Streaming.Center"

The service does not collect user data except for information necessary for user authentication within the Personal Account.

- User email is used for registration to send access details to the Personal Account.
- The email is used for user authorization in the Personal Account and for password recovery.
- The service reserves the right to use the user's email to send important information about updates, including those necessary for the secure operation of the service. However, users can unilaterally opt out of these notifications in the "Account Settings" section of their Personal Account.
- User emails are not used for advertising purposes.
- If a user decides to discontinue using the service, they can request the complete deletion of their information and account through the Personal Account or by contacting the service's technical support.
- If a user does not renew their service subscription by making a payment in the Personal Account, the service will fully delete the user's information 30 days after the payment period ends.
- Deleted user data and accounts cannot be restored.

### Mobile Applications (Android, iOS)

Our applications are designed solely for listening to internet radio stations:
- They do not collect any user information.
- The applications request phone state permission (`android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE`) to pause audio playback during phone calls. Once the call ends, the application resumes the player. The application does not collect any data about the calls or their content.
- Users can independently connect third-party services for app analytics, such as Yandex AppMetrica. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such third-party services.
- The applications contain in-app purchases, except for those specified in Google Play or Apple AppStore.

Anonymous information we receive about the application from third-party services, such as Google Crashlytics, Google Play, Apple AppStore, and others, includes:
- Installation information (e.g., operating system type and application version number).
- Device information (hardware model and operating system version).
- Information about user behavior that caused an application crash.

All data we collect is used solely for internal analysis and research to improve our products and develop more useful features for our users.

We are not responsible for any consequences arising from the use of our applications, including device malfunctions or failures.

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will post any changes to this Privacy Policy on this page. If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, please [write or call us](/contacts).
