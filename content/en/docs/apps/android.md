**Step-by-step guide**
1. Go to the <a href="https://app.streaming.center/login/" target="_blank">order page and register</a>
2. In your dashboard, open the "Applications" -> "Android" section:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder1_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder1.png" >}}
3. Click "Create Mobile App" and choose the basic app settings: name, publishing parameters, and copyright settings:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder2_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder2.png" >}}

4. Fill out all fields in the "Information" section: full and short description, upload logos and icons:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder3_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder3.png" >}}

5. Customize the app appearance in the "Design" section: choose a ready-made skin or set all color elements individually:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder4_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder4.png" >}}

6. In the "Radios" section, you can add **unlimited radio streams** to the app. If multiple stations are added, a station-switching menu will appear in the app:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder5_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder5.png" >}}

7. Each station can have its own logo, stream links, social media links, and a custom "Info" section:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder6_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder6.png" >}}

8. Once all information is filled out correctly, click the "Build App" button in the top menu and wait for the compilation to complete — typically 10–15 minutes:
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder7_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder7.png" >}}

9. Once your app is ready, the download button for the APK file will become available — this file can be downloaded and installed on Android devices (you may need to allow installation from unknown sources on your device):
    {{< lightbox "/images/android_app/en/app_builder8_mini.png" "/images/android_app/en/app_builder8.png" >}}

After the app is created, you will have **5 days of free testing** - install it on various Android devices to fully test its functionality. During testing, you can return to the builder, change any settings, and rebuild the app — all free of charge.

You can share the APK file or a link to your app on Google Play/Huawei App Gallery on your radio station’s website so listeners can easily find and install it.

## Important note about devices and testing

You do not need to have an Android device to create a mobile application in our app builder - the entire process (settings, design, configuration, and build) is done through the web interface.

However, we strongly recommend having at least one Android device for testing. After each build, you can download the APK file, install it manually on any Android smartphone, tablet, Android TV, or Android Auto - compatible device, and fully test the app before publishing to Google Play or Huawei App Gallery.

You can:
- Change app settings in the app builder as many times as you want
- Rebuild the app after each change
- Install and test every new build on your device
- Verify design, playback, stability, and overall user experience

We will publish your app in the app stores only when you are 100% satisfied with the result.

During the free testing period, you have complete flexibility to experiment, refine, and perfect your app - with no risk and no additional cost.



## Updating the app after publication

Even **after your app is published on Google Play**, you can continue to manage and update much of its content **without publishing a new version** to the app store.

The following changes can be made instantly via the app builder and **do not require a Google Play update**:

- Add new radio stations to the app
- Change stream URLs for any existing radio station
- Update radio station logos
- Edit radio station titles and descriptions
- Modify social media links
- Change radio-specific settings, including:
    - Show or hide likes and dislikes
    - Enable or disable the shoutbox (track requests)
    - Enable or disable track cover image display

These updates are delivered dynamically and become available to listeners **without reinstalling or updating the app** from Google Play.

## Changes that require publishing a new app version

Some changes affect the core structure or metadata of the application and therefore require publishing a new version in the application store:
- Changing the main app icon
- Changing the main app logo
- Changing app color themes
- Updating the app title, main description, website URL, or contact email
- Receiving new core engine updates, including:
    - New application features
    - Support for newer Android versions
    - Platform-level improvements and optimizations

In these cases, a new version must be submitted to Google Play (and/or Huawei App Gallery). **Publishing such updates may involve an additional fee**, depending on the scope of changes and update policy at the time.

This approach allows you to freely manage and update your radio content on a daily basis, while keeping full control over when and how store-level updates are released.
