Stereo-Tool is, perhaps, the de facto standard of audio processors for online streaming and its support, of course, has already been implemented in our Internet Radio Platform. This audio processor uses software methods to achieve significant improvements in the sound quality of online radio. The setup is done by connecting special preset files with settings (which are available on the Network, as well as users who own the radio share these files in our Telegram channel). Many functions are available for free, but you can also purchase a product license key, then there will be even more settings and after listening at least once, it will be very difficult for you and you listeners to get back to normal sound, without processing.
