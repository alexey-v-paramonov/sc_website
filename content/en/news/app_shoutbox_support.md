A new type of jingles has been added: minute-by-minute, now you can select a range of hours, say, from 12 to 18 and insert jingles every 10 minutes in this interval. The long-awaited track ordering feature has been improved in mobile apps for Android and iOS. The stability of the repeaters has been improved.
