    Our main product, which we use to build our other products on top of it, is the Internet Radio control panel - that's why we call it the Internet Radio "Platform". The product has been continuously developing since 2006. 
Our control panel is not only a WEB interface for radio broadcasting via standard Icecast and Shoutcast servers, but also contains its own broadcasting module (Auto-DJ), where you can upload music for rotation and broadcasting will work in fully automatic mode, without using third-party broadcasting programs such as Sam Broadcaster or Audio Hijack, although our platform is also compatible with these programs and can use them as a source. One of the most frequently used scenarios is broadcasting from the server in fully automatic mode via Auto-DJ and connecting an external source as Audio Hijack and other broadcasting programs when it is necessary to host a live stream on the radio.
<br/><br/>Our Internet Radio panel can be installed on almost any server running Linux. A virtual server with 1 CPU core and 1gb of RAM is just enough to have 1-5 radios running. Creating a radio is also possible directly on our servers, if you do not have your own server. There is no need to have your own computer permanently connected to the Internet for broadcasting, and please note that in the case of hosting our control panel on your own hosting: common website hosting is not suitable for the panel, you need a dedicated server: virtual or physical.
