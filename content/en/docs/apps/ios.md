# Creating an iOS App for Your Internet Radio
Our company develops mobile applications of any complexity for all popular mobile platforms, including Apple iOS. We offer both comprehensive solutions with custom design, and if you're looking for a simple, reliable, and affordable solution — our iOS app builder service is perfect for you.

## Our advantages:
- Instant creation of an app under your brand: logos, colors, description – you customize all of this in the app builder yourself.
- We regularly update and maintain our app engine, adding support for the latest iOS versions and expanding functionality.
- The app is compatible with both internet radios built on our platform and any other that work with Shoutcast or Icecast broadcasting servers.
- The app can be published in the Apple App Store from our account or your developer accounts.
- Supports iPhone and iPad.
- Ability to make custom modifications to the basic app.
- Affordable cost of the app.
- Payment for the app is one-time, with no subscription fees.

## What you get:
- Stylish design with your brand elements and branding.
- A reliable player for streaming radio.
- A user-friendly interface for listeners.
- Minimal technical support, with the basic version requiring you to simply fill out the app creation form (specify the name, description, logos, and radio streams).
- The ability to quickly update content: stream links, radio descriptions, social media links, without the need for republishing or updating the app in the Apple App Store.
- If the app is built on our Streaming.center streaming platform, additional features will be available: track voting (likes and dislikes) and track requests (shoutbox) for the radio directly from the app.

Don't waste time and money on building from scratch – use our ready-made solution to create a professional mobile app for your internet radio station!

## Step-by-Step Guide
- Go to the <a href="https://app.streaming.center/login/" target="_blank">order page and register</a>.
- In your personal account, open the "Applications" section -> "Apple iOS".

- Click the "Create Mobile App" button and select the basic app settings: name, publishing parameters, and copyright in the app.

- Sequentially fill out all the fields in the "Information" form: specify a full and short description, upload logos and icons.
    {{< lightbox "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder3_mini.png" "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder3.png" >}}

- Customize the appearance of the app in the "Design" section: you can either choose a ready-made "skin" or customize all element colors individually.

- In the "Radio Stations" section of the builder, you can add **any number of radio stations** to the app. If the app has several stations, an additional menu will automatically appear, allowing the listener to switch between stations.

- Each station in the app can have its own logo, radio streams, social media links, and text for the "Info" section in the app.
    {{< lightbox "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder6_mini.png" "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder6.png" >}}

- Once all the information is filled out correctly, send the app for building using the corresponding button in the top menu. Our specialist will compile the app, and we will send you screenshots.
    {{< lightbox "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder7_mini.png" "/images/ios_app/en/app_builder7.png" >}}

- Once your app is ready, our specialist will publish it in the Apple App Store.

Unlike the [Android version](/docs/apps/android) of the app, there is no way to download the app file to your phone without publishing it in the Apple App Store. Therefore, if you are ordering the app for both platforms, you can first create and test the Android version, download it to your phone, and check the result. The iOS app will look identical.


## Changes that require publishing a new app version

Some changes affect the core structure or metadata of the application and therefore require publishing a new version in Apple App Store:
- Changing the main app icon
- Changing the main app logo
- Changing app color themes
- Updating the app title, main description, website URL, or contact email
- Receiving new core engine updates, including:
    - New application features
    - Support for newer iOS versions (released every year)
    - Platform-level improvements and optimizations

In these cases, a new version must be submitted to Apple App Store. **Publishing such updates may involve an additional fee**, depending on the scope of changes and update policy at the time.
