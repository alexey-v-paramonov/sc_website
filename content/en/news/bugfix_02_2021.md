Added ANSI encoding for DJ metadata.
Fixed an issue with incorrect file permissions for uploaded files.
Added the option to show or hide jingles from the playback history from the jing blocks, similar to regular jingles.
Google Chrome has expanded the list of ports that are considered unsafe. All these ports are excluded from possible Shoutcast/Icecast ports
Fixed the operation of interval jingles programmed from 00:00 to 00:00
Added the option to play a specific rotation at the end of the playback of a non-looped playlist.
Fixed bugs in the rotation editing interface.
The ban on repeating tracks now works for blocks of jingles that include a random track from the playlist.
The player built into the admin panel stopped working after playing 3-4 tracks, fixed.
The "Interrupt current track" option did not work for rotations in the broadcast grid, fixed.
Tracks ordered by users are now also excluded from the random selection to eliminate repetitions.
Blocks are no longer deleted if the jingle file included in the block has been deleted.
