## Personal Account Balance
All our services are prepaid by topping up your personal account in your user dashboard. Funds are deducted from the balance as follows:
- Once — for one-time services;
- Daily — for subscription-based services.

You can top up your account in advance for any period. For example, if a service costs 50 USD per month, you can deposit 12 × 50 = 600 USD to cover a full year of usage in advance.

## Payment Methods
The currently available payment methods are listed in the "Payments" section of your [user dashboard](https://app.streaming.center/).
Some payment methods support automatic crediting of funds, while others require you to notify us after making a payment.

## One-Time Payments
For one-time services (e.g., mobile app development, script creation, technical support, etc.), the payment is deducted **once after the service is rendered**. Before this, you must **top up your balance in advance** with the required amount.

## Subscription Fees
For subscription-based services, charges are deducted **daily** in the morning.
The cost is calculated as a proportional part of the monthly fee. For example, if a service costs 30 USD per month, then with a 30-day month, 30 ÷ 30 = 1 USD will be deducted each day.

This gives you flexibility to:

- easily switch plans,
- cancel services,
- add new ones at any time.

For instance, if you add another service costing 60 USD per month, the daily deduction will be: 1 USD (first service) + 60 ÷ 30 = 2 (second service) = **3 USD per day**.
