Our Internet Radio control panel 3.24.2 has been released:
- Audio Editor (where you generate your track waveform and define mix in and out points) has been rewritten completely fixing many bugs.
- "Delete radio" button was moved out from the top bar into the "Settings" section not to confuse users, which ofter remove radio by mistake using the button at the top.
- Jingles and Jingle bloks now have on/off checkbox directly in the list allowing users to toggle many jingles at once.
